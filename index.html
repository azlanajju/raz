    Revolt of 1857

    </strong>
    Also called India’s first war of independence, it began at Meerut on May 10, 1857, and slowly spread across Delhi, Agra, Kanpur and Lucknow.
    It was the first significant uprising against the East India Company. Although the Revolt was unsuccessful, it had a significant impact on the masses and inspired India’s entire Independence Movement.

<strong>
    Swadeshi Movement – 1905-1911:

</strong>
The Swadeshi Movement was a consequence of Lord Curzon’s announcement for the partition of Bengal in 1905, on the grounds that the population of Bengal as a whole would be difficult to govern over.
However, the British declared the division of Bengal into two provinces with the intention of undermining nationalist unity.

<strong>
Ghadhar Movement- 1914-1917:
</strong>
The Ghadar Movement was a significant turning point in India’s quest for independence. Early in the 20th century, a number of stringent immigration laws based on racial discrimination were put in place to reduce the number of Indian immigrants coming to Canada in search of employment.

<strong>
Khilafat and Non- Cooperation Movement – 1920 

</strong>
Khilafat Movement: The Indian Muslims were not happy with the way the British dethroned the Caliph in Turkey. So, in 1919, various protests were held against the Britishers. The Muslim League and Congress came together during this time. Both of these parties worked together to organise numerous political protests. The movement was initially introduced on August 31, 1920, when the Khilafat Committee began a campaign of non-cooperation.

<strong>
Quit India Movement – 1942

<div>
</strong>
The INC called for a widespread civil disobedience movement when the Cripps Mission, which arrived in India in March 1942, was unable to promise any type of constitutional remedy for India’s issues.
The idea of an independence movement in India was accepted by the Congress Working Committee at its Wardha meeting on July 14, 1942.
Gandhi began this movement in August 1942 in an effort to compel the British to leave India. This campaign, known as the “Bharat Chhodo Andolan,” compelled the British colonial authorities to consider leaving India.
